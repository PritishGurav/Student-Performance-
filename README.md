# üìò Student Performance: An Insightful Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Student Performance Analysis** project!  
This project allowed me to explore the world of data analytics, focusing on how various factors influence student achievements.  
With the aid of the **WsCube Tech YouTube channel**, I used **Jupyter Notebook** to uncover meaningful insights from the data.

## üåü Project Overview

This project dives deep into student performance data, analyzing their distribution across key categories such as **marks**, **gender**, and **parental marital status**.  
The goal was to understand how these factors contribute to their academic outcomes and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

### Project Objectives:
- **Analyze Student Distribution**: Explore patterns based on marks, gender, and parental marital status.
- **Uncover Key Insights**: Identify correlations and trends affecting performance.
- **Visualize Findings**: Represent data insights through engaging visualizations.

Using **Jupyter Notebook**, I performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to create a comprehensive understanding of student performance metrics.
